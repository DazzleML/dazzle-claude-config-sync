"""Three-way merge orchestration -- ccs drives git and the user's diff tool.

**The three-way itself is git's.** ``git merge-file`` computes the 3-way;
``git mergetool`` already drives ~20 tools through the ``$LOCAL $BASE $REMOTE
$MERGED`` contract, and ccs reimplements neither. What ccs adds sits above
that engine: which manifest entries may be merged at all; whether the result
actually kept both sides' content; since 0.5.16, what each tool does with a
$MERGED that already holds a person's work (the capability registry below),
which decides whether a resumed file may be reopened; and, when ``--ai``
lands (#19), a resolution workflow for the hunks that are not a side-pick --
deterministic classification first, a model on the residue, the same
validation gate on the result. That workflow is a merge *process*, not a
second diff3; the invariant below binds it exactly as it binds a hand edit.

THE INVARIANT (measured three times, three different costumes -- see DWP-5):

    Success means VALIDATED CONTENT SURVIVAL, never "the tool returned 0."

    - ``git merge-file`` with base==theirs   -> exit 0, 56 lines silently dropped
    - ``git merge-file`` with base==ours     -> exit 0, all 7 CLAUDE_USER_DIR refs deleted
    - upstream deletes an untouched file     -> exit 0, a depended-on skill vanishes

Every gate below exists because of one of those. If a future change short-circuits
validation because "git said it was clean", it reintroduces the whole class.

Phase 1 (this module) is the hand-off: plan, seed, validate, launch. It needs no
merge base -- with no base it degrades to an honest 2-way and says so. Phase 2
(machine branches) makes the base exact; nothing here has to change for it.

    Nothing records which commit a live tree was last synced to, so the
    base is ESTIMATED from the checkout's history. The estimate follows
    five rules, each traceable to a measured failure (2026-08-21; scenario
    classes SC-nn are from the scenario-space DWP):

      1. HEAD is a candidate. HEAD *is* the sync point in the most common
         workflow -- apply, then edit live (SC-11a). Excluding it meant every
         ordinary post-sync edit of a single-file entry was refused as
         two-sided; that is why every refusal anyone saw was CLAUDE.md.
         But HEAD must beat at least one OLDER candidate: with a one-commit
         history "HEAD is nearest" is tautological, indistinguishable from
         adoption (SC-80), and refused.
      2. A candidate equal to OURS is returned at once. Live then holds
         nothing unique relative to it -- distance zero, proof not guess.
         Skipping such candidates labelled 22 one-sided files "both" (SC-10).
      3. A candidate equal to THEIRS (HEAD included) is exempt from the
         phantom check -- every deletion is "retained by theirs" by
         definition there, so the check would reject the true base whenever
         live deleted >= 3 lines (SC-12) -- but it must win the distance
         contest STRICTLY. A revert makes HEAD equal an older commit while
         the checkout genuinely moved (SC-14); and on an exact tie HEAD would
         otherwise win by an immunity it did not earn (scenario E: live
         deleted three lines, checkout replaced the same three).
      4. The nearest candidate is chosen over ALL candidates, rejected ones
         included. If the nearest was phantom-rejected, return None: a farther
         base is a wrong base, and falling back to HEAD turned refusals into
         silent passes (SC-22).
      5. The phantom check stays for dissimilar candidates: a "base" that
         attributes deletions to us which theirs still holds is likelier a
         sibling than an ancestor.

    Returning None is an honest answer: refuse, degrade to a two-way hand-off,
    never invent a third input. Known residual, undecidable from the two files
    and this history: adoption (no sync point exists) and a byte-exact hand
    revert of live -- both belong to `adopt` / a recorded sync point.

    `collect` and `apply` treat "differs" as ordinary work: both bucket
    `d.modified` in with the safe one-sided cases and copy straight over it.
    For a file whose two sides each hold unique content that is silent data
    loss reported as success -- measured at 50 lines of CLAUDE.md.

    Detection needs the base, because two states cannot distinguish "they
    added" from "we deleted". A file with no recoverable base is reported too:
    unknown is not the same as safe.

    Coverage is PER-FILE via diff_all, so directory-target entries (skills/,
    commands/ -- the dominant real payload shape) are protected the same as
    single-file entries. Until 0.4.x this guard checked is_file() on the entry
    target and silently skipped every directory entry (TW1, checklist run-03:
    a real collect overwrote a committed diverged edit and exited 0).

    Seed-if-absent entries are deliberately NOT guarded: `collect` never
    touches them (diff_all covers copy entries only) and `apply` never
    overwrites an existing live file for them, so neither one-way verb can
    destroy a diverged seed -- refusing the whole run over one was pure
    over-refusal. `ccs merge` still offers them via the HEAD axis.

    RESOLVED files never appear here: diff_all's `modified` list is built with
    files_differ, which is EOL-normalized, so a file whose live copy matches
    the checkout's WORKING TREE (a finished merge; HEAD moves only on commit)

    Writes to `repo_dest`, NOT `repo`. On the HEAD axis `repo` is the staged
    copy of theirs inside the merge workspace, so writing there installed
    nothing into the payload repo and destroyed the staged original. The live
    tree got the merge, the checkout did not, and `--accept` reported success.

    The merge runs on LF-normalised copies, so the result is restored to the
    line-ending style the LIVE file already used -- rewriting a 966-line file
    from CRLF to LF would show up as a whole-file change in every later diff.
