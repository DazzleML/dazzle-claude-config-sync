"""Adoption merges: a base supplied from outside the checkout, and what the
three-way merge would silently let go of.

A box that forked its file before the payload existed has no ancestor in the
checkout's history. Its true ancestor may live one repository over (the home
repo of the machine that seeded it). Handed that base, `git merge-file`
produces a correct merge -- and a correct merge DROPS every region the
payload removed since the ancestor while the box left it untouched. Honoured
deletions, by three-way semantics; and on a box that keeps its own manual,
exactly the lines nobody wants to lose. Measured on the real file: 166 lines
in 38 headings gone, no marker, no word.

Two pieces, both pure functions over line lists so they can be tested without
git and shared by `merge` and its `--dry-run` table:

- **conflict-on-delete**: every base region that theirs removed while ours
  kept it verbatim is stripped from the base before the merge (so it reads
  as an ours-insertion and survives into the clean output) and then, where
  it landed in the clean output, re-wrapped as a reviewer hunk with the
  region on the ours and base panes and nothing on theirs. The reviewer
  decides; nothing is silent. 166 lines -> 24 hunks, 0 lost, on the real file.
- **the loss table**: per side, the lines unique to that side that are absent
  from the clean output and from every hunk ("silent"); of those, the ones
  in the base (honoured deletions) and the ones NOT in the base -- a side's
  own addition, gone. The last number must be 0; anything else is a tool bug.

Counting cannot tell a good base from a bad one -- `merge-file` never drops a
side's additions, so every silent loss is an honoured deletion, and whether
that is benign (the other box's OS section) or a catastrophe (this box's
service manual) is a matter of provenance and review. The table gives the
reviewer the facts; it does not decide for them.
