"""User preferences for ccs behaviour -- distinct from the sync manifest.

The manifest answers "what syncs where"; this answers "how should ccs behave
when it needs a decision". Keeping them apart matters: the manifest is payload
that travels between machines, while these are per-machine preferences that
should NOT travel (one box has a GUI diff tool, another is a headless VPS).

Resolution order, first hit wins:
    explicit argument  >  environment variable  >  config file  >  built-in

Lives in user territory (`~/claude/ccs-config.json`), not `~/.claude` -- that
directory is Claude Code's and gets swept during upgrades.
