where that <repo>@<sha>:<path> comes from -- the ancestor is the last revision
BOTH copies descended from: the file as it was when this box was first set up
from another machine. It is almost always in that other machine's git history:
  git -C <repo> log --oneline --date=short --format="%h %ad %s" -- .claude/CLAUDE.md
      # <repo> = the home repo of the machine that seeded this box (many
      #          people track ~/.claude in one), a backup repo, or the payload
      #          itself if it is old enough; .claude/CLAUDE.md = the file's path
      #          inside that repo. Pick the commit from around the day the box
      #          was set up -- the most recent one BEFORE the two copies diverged.
  git -C <repo> show <sha>:.claude/CLAUDE.md | head     # eyeball it; it should read like both copies' common past
  (a copy of that old file on disk works too: --base-file FILE)

how to know you picked the right one -- the --dry-run table:
  `lost` must be 0 (if it is not, that is a tool bug, not your ancestor); and the
  first lines it names under "retired upstream" / "ours-del" should be sections
  you recognise as the OTHER machine's, or as genuinely retired. A heading THIS
  box wrote showing up as "retired upstream" means the ancestor never held it --
  wrong revision; try an earlier one.

refusal means: docs/merge.md in the ccs repository.

  Clone into ~/claude (or anywhere), NOT into ~/.claude -- the checkout is
  not your live config. Set CCS_CHECKOUT_DIR to stop passing --checkout-dir.

  ccs status                     # what drifted, and which side owns each change
  ccs merge                      # files changed on BOTH sides -- see the warning below

  ccs git add -A && ccs git commit && ccs git push   # share it, from any directory

  Directions are named from the payload's side: the checkout COLLECTS from a
  box; its contents APPLY to a box (the same `apply` as chezmoi and kubectl).

  A file that changed on BOTH sides needs `ccs merge`. `collect` and `apply`
  are ONE-WAY copies, so running either on such a file discards whatever the
  losing side added -- silently, and with a success message. `ccs status`
  marks those entries; `ccs merge --preview` shows you the three versions in
  your own diff tool before you commit to anything.

  A machine whose file forked BEFORE the payload existed has no ancestor in
  the checkout; `ccs merge -h` shows how to hand it one.

  Preferences (diff tool, status verbosity, AI merge command) live in
  ~/claude/ccs-config.json; each is also a per-run flag and an env var.

  A seed-if-absent entry delivers a STARTER FILE once, to a machine that
  lacks it. After that the file is yours: ccs never copies it again in
  either direction, and status does not count it as drift.

the words on a status/doctor line:
  the payload's (copy / starter / seed)
      the version in the checkout -- what a brand-new machine would get
  your copy / yours
      the live file it delivered, owned by this box ever since
  "differs"
      the two are no longer the same: you edited yours, the payload
      shipped a newer starter, or both

where the files live:
  your copy       under ~/.claude or ~/claude (the entry's target --
                  the exact path is printed under the status line)
  the payload's   inside the checkout (printed alongside)
  your decisions  ~/claude/ccs-seed-decisions.json (plain JSON, yours
                  to edit; ccs seed reset removes one entry cleanly)

the three answers when yours differs:
  keep yours      ccs seed keep <file> --until-changed   (asks again only
                  if the payload's starter changes; --always never asks)
  take theirs     ccs seed migrate <file>
  look first      ccs seed diff <file>, or open the two printed paths

what `seed migrate` does, in order:
  1. hashes your live file
  2. keeps a copy of it OUTSIDE the apply backup tree (written by a
     different code path, so one bug cannot quietly spoil both copies)
  3. takes the payload's version (apply --reseed underneath, which makes
     its own backup as always)
  4. proves it: both copies must hash to your pre-migration bytes, and
     the live file must now match the payload's

  Bare `ccs seed migrate` lists the starter files this box could migrate.
  --dry-run says what would happen and writes nothing.

    Looks in the DIFFERING set first, then falls back to resolving against the
    manifest, so a file that is perfectly in sync still resolves. Without the
    fallback an in-sync file was indistinguishable from a typo -- and after a
    merge, in-sync is the normal state.

    A third step, taken only when `manifest`, `checkout` and `roots` are all
    given: single-file entries of ANY strategy, straight from the manifest.
    `diff_all` walks copy entries only, so a seed-if-absent file -- the very
    file merge's seed refusal tells you to name -- was unreachable here, and
    for one release `ccs merge settings.local.json` resolved while `ccs diff
    settings.local.json` did not. The step is the resolver's, not any one
    verb's, so the four verbs that take a path cannot drift again. It honours
    the box gate the same way the differing set does: a tag-gated entry is
    not a match, so the caller's "not for this box" explanation still fires.

    A bare filename that lives in two entries (`SAME.md` under both `s/` and
    `t/`) used to resolve to whichever entry came first in the manifest, with
    no sign that a second candidate existed (found by the v0.4.1 checklist
    sweep). That is a confident wrong answer at the path layer; it now raises
    AmbiguousPath so the caller can list the candidates and ask for a
    qualified path instead.
