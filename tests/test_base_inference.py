"""Base inference: does ccs find the right ancestor when one side is unchanged?

Written RED on 2026-08-21 against 84026c8, before the fix, to verify the
diagnosis in:
  private/claude/2026-08-21__03-27-24__dev-workflow-process__status-mislabels-one-sided-drift-as-two-sided.md

Each test states the failure it predicts on the unfixed code. If a test
passes unexpectedly, the diagnosis is wrong and the fix should not proceed.

Real-world trigger: `ccs status` on the dev machine labelled 22 one-sided files as
"differs on both sides". Live equalled an ancestor commit byte-for-byte;
`infer_base` skips any candidate equal to a side ("degenerate"), so it either
found no base (-> flagged) or fell through to an OLDER ancestor (-> flagged).

The existing test_two_way_labels_ignores_one_sided_drift is misnamed: it sets
live == HEAD, which is "in sync", not one-sided. The one-sided case -- live
== base while HEAD moved on -- is what these tests add.
