"""`ccs setup update` -- teach an existing config the keys this ccs knows (#32).

A config file freezes at the schema of whatever version wrote it, and nothing
ever updated it. That was a latent annoyance until v0.5.10 added
`sync_removals`, a default that MOVES FILES -- at which point a machine could
acquire a file-touching behaviour on upgrade with nothing in its own config
recording that the setting exists.

Shaped after `csb setup update`: it ACTS where the action has exactly one right
answer, and names the exact remedy where it does not. Adding a missing key at
its documented default is such an action, so there is no per-key prompt.

The load-bearing property is ADDITIVE-ONLY, and the subtle half of it is
`test_a_value_the_user_set_TO_THE_DEFAULT_is_not_rewritten`: a key whose value
happens to equal the default is indistinguishable from one ccs wrote, and must
be left alone anyway. The rule is about provenance, not equality.
