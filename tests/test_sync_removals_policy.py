"""Retired files: remove what is not yours, keep what is (#31).

When the payload deliberately deletes a file, every box keeps its live copy
until a human runs `ccs apply --sync-removals`. That is a manual step per box
per retirement, and until it happens the box is half-migrated -- carrying both
`commands/addendum.md` and `skills/addendum/SKILL.md`, so both load, which is
the exact ambiguity the migration existed to remove.

The default is now `untouched`, and the NARROWING matters more than the
default: a retired file is staged away only when the live copy still matches a
committed version, i.e. holds nothing of the user's. A copy the user edited is
reported instead. Staging that away silently is the one thing this tool
refuses to do.
