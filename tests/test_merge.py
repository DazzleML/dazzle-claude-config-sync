Every test here maps to a failure that was MEASURED, not imagined. The
governing invariant, from DWP-5:

    Success means VALIDATED CONTENT SURVIVAL, never "the tool returned 0."

The three costumes that invariant wears, all reproduced below:
  * base == theirs -> git exits 0, one side's additions vanish
  * base == ours   -> git exits 0, the other side's additions vanish
  * a missing input -> git exits 255, which read as "255 conflicts" and looked
