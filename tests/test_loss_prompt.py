"""The no-base loss prompt, and the width helper it reads through.

The maintainer met the prompt on a real merge (2026-09-03) and could not tell
what it wanted: a sentence trailing into `--`, "ours" for his own live file,
"(1)" for a count, a line cut at 100 characters with nothing to say so, and a
question that never said what `y` or `N` would do. Until then the prompt had
one test -- the non-interactive refusal -- and no person had seen it rendered.
These pin the words, the count, the cut marker and its absence, and the two
sentences that say what each answer does.
